			<p>That's the end of the tour. The projects you have been exploring are just a small sample of those that the Chinese government, and its donor agencies, are supporting in Africa.</p>

			<p>You can now check out a map of Chinese-backed projects and investments on the continent, which is based on information from the <a href="http://china.aiddata.org" target="_blank">ChinaAid database</a>, the largest public database of Chinese development finance in Africa. The database is based on cross-checked media-reports (<a href="http://china.aiddata.org/content/methodology" target="_target">see their methodology</a>) and is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to be a springboard to further research and more transparency.</p>

			<p>If you would like to explore the individual projects again, please restart the tour.</p>

			<p>According to the <a href="http://china.aiddata.org" target="_blank">AidData database</a>, from 2000 to 2012 Chinese government agencies financed more than 1900 projects across Africa.</p>

<p>The total amount of money that China committed to these schemes was at least $128bn. However, only 59% of the projects are identified as implemented or completed, while the remainder are still promised or planned. In 37% of the projects identified, the amount of money allocated is not known.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Burkina Faso, Swaziland, the Gambia and Sao Tome and Principe did not receive any Chinese money. Unusual for Africa nowadays. But these countries have recognised Taiwan, which China regards a renegade province, as an independent state. 
The Gambia and Sao Tome and Principe, however, <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?a=72148&i=15543" target="_blank">recently broke</a> diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which some analysts saw as proof of China’s growing clout on the continent with its spending there soaring.</p>
